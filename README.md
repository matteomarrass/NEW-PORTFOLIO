# NEW-PORTFOLIO
My new Portfolio

Purposes overview:

  * Make a completely new portfolio

I made this project because it was requested as a practice project to do in the Full-Stack Web Developer course by Codecademy.

Features: 
  * Mobile Responsive
  * Some JS things in the first page (if you click in a part of the screen the language will switch from Italian to English)
  * Basic HTML/CSS things

Resources:
  * Flaticon (icons)
  * MDN, W3School (as a studying material)
